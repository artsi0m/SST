  abstract = {One of the key tasks in the design of small-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is to ensure acceptable and certifiable reliability indicators for accepted components of commercial off-the-shelf systems (CGS). Ball bearings and sleeve bearings are the most common type of bearings used in engines. Worn bearings, vibration, overcurrent and dirty potentiometers are among the causes of failures, in addition to component wear. The article presents experimental results obtained to quantify the reliability of MBLA servomotors by recording their time to failure in a certain set of test runs. Servos are widely used in modern high-precision control systems for moving objects. The Weibull prediction model is used for quantitative analysis and related key mathematical models and can be applied to a wide range of data. Operating time to failure, number of cycles to failure, mileage to failure, mechanical damage or similar continuous parameters must be recorded for all objects. The methodology adopted for conducting tests and used for the experiment is described. The design elements, their interrelation and the order of operation on an unmanned aerial vehicle are considered in detail.},

  abstract = {Resistors plays a major role in reducing the current in circuits and therefore protecting circuits from damage resulting from overdraw of current by dissipating the kinetic energy of electrons in current as thermal energy (heat). This is what allows electricity to be useful: the electrical potential energy from the voltage source is converted to kinetic energy of the electrons, which is then transferred to something we wish to power, such as a toaster or a …},
